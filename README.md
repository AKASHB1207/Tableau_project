The project focuses on analyzing how various factors influence customer decisions and sales outcomes. It includes key attributes such as Customer ID, Age, Loyalty Membership, Order Status, Product Type, Payment Method, Shipping Type, Total Price, Unit Price, Quantity, Rating, Electronic Sales, Add-on Purchase, and Add-on Total. These parameters provide valuable insights into customer preferences, spending habits, and satisfaction levels.
The analysis reveals that a significant 78.27% of customers are not loyalty members, indicating limited engagement in loyalty programs and highlighting an opportunity to improve customer retention. Variations in product types, payment methods, and shipping preferences demonstrate diverse consumer needs and buying behaviors. The study also emphasizes the importance of add-on purchases, which contribute notably to overall revenue.
